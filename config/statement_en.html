				<p>Mahjong is a very complex game, it will take a lot of effort to write down the rules in this statement. So instead, here are two sources to learn basic mahjong rules:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/_JGsb87PEIo?si=o3EIotHE_6podgRD">A very helpful youtube video</a></li>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.coololdgames.com/tile-games/mahjong/hong-kong/">A very helpful article</a></li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Terminology</h2>

				<p>
				Different resources may use different terms. In this part, when a pair of terms is shown, the first word is the one used in this statement and the video, and the second is used in the article.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>GONG/KONG: making a quadruple meld.</li>
					<li>PONG/PUNG: making a triple meld.</li>
					<li>SEUNG/CHOW: forming a meld of three consecutive tiles, or a STRAIGHT in poker terms.</li>
					<li>FAN (/fʌn/) - unit of the worth of a hand.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Tiles</h2>

				<p>Each tile is represented by 2 characters, the first being the representation of the tile category, while the second being the value. As mentioned in the tutorial above, there are 4 tiles of each category-value combination.</p>

				<br />

				<p>List of tile categories, and their character representation:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><const>D</const>ot - <const>1</const>~<const>9</const></li>
					<li><const>B</const>amboo - <const>1</const>~<const>9</const></li>
					<li><const>C</const>haracter - <const>1</const>~<const>9</const></li>
					<li><const>W</const>ind - <const>1</const>~<const>4</const></li>
					<li>d<const>R</const>agon - <const>1</const>~<const>3</const></li>
					<li><const>F</const>lower - <const>1</const>~<const>4</const></li>
					<li><const>S</const>eason - <const>1</const>~<const>4</const></li>
				</ul>

				<p>For the suited tiles (Dot, Bamboo, Character), the value will be the numeral value. For example, "5 Dot" is represented as <const>d5</const>, while "1 Bamboo" is represented as <const>b1.</const></p>

				<br>

				<p>For the other tile categories, the value represents the index of the tile type (starting from <const>1</const>), the types are ordered as follow:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Wind tile: East, South, West, North</li>
					<li>Dragon tile: Red dragon, Green dragon, White dragon</li>
					<li>Flower tile: Plum, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, Bamboo</li>
					<li>Season tile: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter</li>
				</ul>

				<p>For example, South will be represented as <const>w2</const>, and White dragon will be represented as <const>r3</const>.</p>

				<br>

				<h2>Rounds</h2>

				<p>
				Each round, you will receive a list of actions taken by other players since your last turn, with the actions you committed <strong>last round</strong> being given first. You can only get non-draw actions by other players, as you aren't supposed to know what they drew.
				</p>

				<br>

				<p>There are 2 types of <var>roundType</var>, <const>normal</const> and <const>interrupt</const>.

				<br>

				Every player (including the dealer) receives 13 tiles at the beginning. Gameplay starts with a normal round, the first player (player with <var>windSeat</var>=<const>0</const>) may perform any action allowed in the normal round. After that, the next player will do the same thing. This continues until someone discards a card that <u>at least one player</u> can form a meld with it. The interrupt round then starts, every player that have the opportunity to perform an interrupting action receives input (while those who can't will not receive anything).

				The game returns to a normal round for the player subsequent to the interrupting player if there is one, or the player subsequent to the discarding player if there is none. Gameplay continues until one player wins by completing the hand.
				</p>

				<br>

				<p>In normal round, the last actions of the list will be about the tile you drew, including the <action>FLOWER</action> actions which are done automatically by the referee (both actions will be done in the same turn, just keep in mind that in normal round the last action is always <action>DRAW</action>). In normal mode, you can perform a <action>DISCARD</action> action, or a <action>GONG</action> action if you are able to perform a <i>Concealed gong</i> or <i>Exposed kong from exposed pong</i> (Details below).

				<br>

				P.S. You can now only perform both type of these gong at the same round you drew the tile you want to gong with. For example, if you have 3 w1 and just drew another w1 in this round, you can only GONG it now and if you don't you will not have a chance to GONG it again, which according to the rules, you should be able to do that. The option to perform these gong after the round is still not implemented yet (WIP). (Ignore the formatting this part will be erased after it is done)

				</p>

				<br>

				<p>In interrupt round, the last action of the list will be a discard. It means that you have an oppurtunity to interrupt the normal move sequence, with actions like <action>WIN</action>, <action>GONG</action>, <action>PONG</action> and <action>SEUNG</action>.

				<br>

				For <action>PONG</action> and <action>SEUNG</action>, everything will be handled in the same turn, but for <action>GONG</action> (committed in any round type), the <action>DRAW</action> action will be given to the player as a <const>normal</const> round in the next round.

				</p>

				<br>

				<p>Since this is WIP, you still can't do a win action.</p>

				<br>

				<p>If you don't want to perform any action, you can output <action>PASS</action> (only available in interrupt round). Even if you output your action, you won't always be able to successfully perform it, as other player might have a higher priority than you. To know if you have succeeded in performing it, you can refer to actions of the next normal round (as stated earlier, the list of actions start with the actions you performed last round, so if you don't receive that, it means that you didn't successfully commit it).</p>

				<h2>General game rules</h2>

				The video and article above should cover pretty much everything, this part is used to clarify some stuff not mentioned there.

				<ul>
					<li><action>GONG</action><br>

					There are actually more varieties of <action>GONG</action> than the one stated in the article and video. Quoted from wikipedia:

					<ol><li><i>Concealed gong</i> – After drawing a tile, if a player holds four matching tiles, they may declare a gong. The player can also declare if they hold three matching tiles (concealed pong) and upon drawing a tile completes a set of four.</li>

					<li><i>Exposed gong</i> – If a player can use a discarded tile to complete three matching tiles (concealed pong) in their hand, they can take the piece and reveal an "exposed gong" or "melded gong".</li>
					
					<li><i>Exposed gong from exposed pong</i> – If a player already has a melded pong and then later in the game draws the fourth piece from the wall, they may announce (then or later in the game) a gong by placing the fourth tile on top of the middle piece of the melded pong, or all four tiles placed face up in a row. If a pong has been melded a player cannot steal the fourth piece if another player discards it – it must be drawn.</li></ol>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Scoring</h2>

				<p>
				WIP, scoring is not yet implemented.

				When playing mahjong with money, the money earned by the winner is determined by how good the hand is. In this game, this score will only be used for qualification of winning. In order to declare win, your hand should be worth at least 3 fans.

				<br>

				The list of all possible scorings is available in <a _target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_mahjong_scoring_rules#Scoring_table">this Wikipedia page</a>. As you can see there's a lot of scorings that is 100% based on RNG, will specify those scorings that don't exist in this game in the future.
